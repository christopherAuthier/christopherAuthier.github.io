Hi, my name is Christopher Authier! I worked in web development gaining experience creating systems features and improvements, designing data models and maintaining various web applications powered with open-source software like PHP and MySQL.

I like spending time outdoors, watching movies and playing video games.

Come join me in my adventures and discoveries.
