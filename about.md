Hi, my name is Christopher Authier! I am a systems administrator with a web development background. I have gained experience creating systems features and improvements, designing data models and maintaining various web applications powered with technologies such as PHP, mysql, httpd, nginx, Git, docker.

I like spending time outdoors, watching movies and playing video games.

Come join me in my adventures and discoveries.
