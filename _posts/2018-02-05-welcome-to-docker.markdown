First off, Docker is awesome!

Docker lets you create containers for all the dependencies you need to run any applications.

Docker Hub provides [official images](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) for the most popular software such as nginx, mysql, node.js ...

You can also create your own images, I suggest you take a look at the [Alpine Linux image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/), a small security-focused distribution.

If you haven't tried containers already, I strongly suggest you give it a try.
