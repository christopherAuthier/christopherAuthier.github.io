I had been thinking for a long time about starting my personal blog. I will start to write articles about the problems I encounter and the solutions and workarounds I use on a daily basis.

I stumbled upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), read the documentation and got started.

Once I had my static website, I needed somewhere to host it. That's when [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) came into play.

My site was up right after pushing my files on Github. Simple as that.
