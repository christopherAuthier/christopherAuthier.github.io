I had been thinking for a long time about starting my personal blog. I will start to write articles about the problems I encounter and the solutions and workarounds I use on a daily basis.

I stumbled upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), read the documentation and got started.

Once I had my static website, I needed somewhere to host it. That's when [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) came into play.

My site was up right after pushing my files on Github. Simple as that.

**Update (05-02-2018):**

Youâ€™ll find this post in the `_posts` directory of [my repository](https://github.com/christopherAuthier/christopherAuthier.github.io) in Github.

Check out the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
